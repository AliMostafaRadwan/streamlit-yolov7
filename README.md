# streamlit-yolov7
Display predicted Video, Images and webcam using YOLOv7 model with Streamlit

Streamlit Dashboard: https://naseemap47-streamlit-yolov7-app-deploy-bfr4xt.streamlitapp.com/

Streamlit Server don't have GPU, so to deploy model, I used **deploy** branch

Only **master** contain all codes and details.

So better to clone **master** branch and run in your own system
```
git clone https://github.com/naseemap47/streamlit-yolov7.git
cd streamlit-yolov7
```
Run **Streamlit**
```
streamlit run app.py
```
